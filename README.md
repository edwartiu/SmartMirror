# SmartMirror Project

## Description

We're trying to create our own personal SmartMirror that will use a Raspberry Pi to display our widgets and applications to a monitor that is covered with two-way glass mirror to 
allow the user to see their own reflection while using the multiple capabilities of the SmartMirror
